    <p>STEM is an educational program developed to prepare primary and secondary students for college, graduate study and
    careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In addition to subject-specific
    learning, STEM aims to foster inquiring minds, logical reasoning and collaboration skills.
    
    The goal of STEM programs is to increase the supply of qualified high-tech workers in the U.S., bolster innovation,
    improve the country's competitive position globally and strengthen economic growth. STEM gained importance in the early
    2000s following the publication of several reports. One 2005 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering
    and Medicine entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" emphasized the importance of science and technology jobs in
    fostering innovation, addressing societal problems and maintaining U.S. prosperity.</p>
    <div id="test">STEM in higher education teaches students to think critically, prepares them for careers and creates professionals that
    can work across scientific disciplines to solve challenging problems.
    
    STEM integrates multiple disciplines and trains students to use cross-disciplinary knowledge to solve problems.
    Additionally, STEM students take a rigorous and varied course load and develop a strong work ethic.
    
    STEM programs promote a learn-by-doing approach. Students participate in real-world projects with real-world
    consequences. For example, students often participate in university research programs. This approach allows students to
    learn while also taking an active role in the development of emerging technology and groundbreaking research.</div>
