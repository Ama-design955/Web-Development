    Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar
    or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring
    is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
    incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured
    cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures
    (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

    <p>ICE CREAM</p>

        Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type of rich ice cream. Soft serve is softer and is often served at
        amusement parks and fast-food restaurants in the United States. Ice creams made from cow's milk alternatives, such as
        goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, oat, cashew, coconut, almond milk, or tofu), are available for
        those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan. Banana "nice cream"[a] is a 100% fruit-based
        vegan alternative. Frozen yoghurt, or "froyo", is similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be lower in fat. Fruity
        sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are often available in ice cream shops.
