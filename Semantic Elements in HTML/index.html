                <h2>Facts About Australia</h2>
                <p>
                    Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent,
                    the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It has a total area of 7,688,287 kmÂ², making it the sixth-largest
                    country in the world and the largest in Oceania.

                    Australia is the only country in the world that covers an entire continent. It is one of the largest countries on Earth.
                    Although it is rich in natural resources and has a lot of fertile land, more than one-third of Australia is desert.
                    
                    Most Australian cities and farms are located in the southwest and southeast, where the climate is more comfortable.
                    There are dense rain forests in the northeast. The famous outback (remote rural areas) contains the country's largest
                    deserts, where there are scorching temperatures, little water, and almost no vegetation.
