    <h1>Typography with water</h1>
    <div class="text1">water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid
    states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room
    temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a
    solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have originated in the aqueous solutions of the world’s
    oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as blood and digestive juices, for biological processes.
    Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears
    colourless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths.</div>
    <div class="text2"> Although the molecules of water are simple in structure (H2O), the physical and chemical properties of the compound are
    extraordinarily complicated, and they are not typical of most substances found on Earth. For example, although the sight
    of ice cubes floating in a glass of ice water is commonplace, such behaviour is unusual for chemical entities. For
    almost every other compound, the solid state is denser than the liquid state; thus, the solid would sink to the bottom
    of the liquid. The fact that ice floats on water is exceedingly important in the natural world, because the ice that
    forms on ponds and lakes in cold areas of the world acts as an insulating barrier that protects the aquatic life below.
    If ice were denser than liquid water, ice forming on a pond would sink, thereby exposing more water to the cold
    temperature. Thus, the pond would eventually freeze throughout, killing all the life-forms present.</div>
    <div class="text3">Water occurs as a liquid on the surface of Earth under normal conditions, which makes it invaluable for transportation,
    for recreation, and as a habitat for a myriad of plants and animals. The fact that water is readily changed to a vapour
    (gas) allows it to be transported through the atmosphere from the oceans to inland areas where it condenses and, as
    rain, nourishes plant and animal life. (See hydrosphere: The hydrologic cycle for a description of the cycle by which
    water is transferred over Earth.)</div>
    <p class="p1">When an active metal such as sodium is placed in contact with liquid water, a violent exothermic (heat-producing)
    reaction occurs that releases flaming hydrogen gas.</p>
    <p class="p2">The water molecule is not linear but bent in a special way. The two hydrogen atoms are bound to the oxygen atom at an
    angle of 104.5°.</p>
