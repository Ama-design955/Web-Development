    <p>winter, coldest season of the year, between autumn and spring; the name comes from an old Germanic word that means “time
    of water” and refers to the rain and snow of winter in middle and high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere it is
    commonly regarded as extending from the winter solstice (year’s shortest day), December 21 or 22, to the vernal equinox
    (day and night equal in length), March 20 or 21, and in the Southern Hemisphere from June 21 or 22 to September 22 or
    23. The low temperatures associated with winter occur only in middle and high latitudes; in equatorial regions,
    temperatures are almost uniformly high throughout the year. For physical causes of the seasons, see season.</p>
